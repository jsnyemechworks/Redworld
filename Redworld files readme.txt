Hi Red.

You can download the repository by pressing the green "code" button and selecting "download as zip" all the way on the bottom.

Once you have it downloaded make sure you unzip all the .7z files to folders, and merge all the "parts" together.  So entities "part2.7z" should be unzipped to folder "entities part 2", and be merged into the regular "entities" folder, otherwise some funky stuff might happen with the world.

See "this is what the world folder should look like.png" for how the files should be organized.
